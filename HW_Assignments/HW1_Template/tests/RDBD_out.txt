Testing Method test_init: 

Test the initial connection to data base- If correct the query should return 162 rows
Does the query return 162 rows? True

Testing Find By Template Method:
if True should return a list of two dictionaries with above field
[{'playerID': 'willite01', 'nameFirst': 'Ted', 'nameLast': 'Williams', 'birthCity': 'San Diego'}, {'playerID': 'willitr01', 'nameFirst': 'Trevor', 'nameLast': 'Williams', 'birthCity': 'San Diego'}]

Testing Find By Primary Key Method: The test is conducted on the appearances table to check the multiple key case
If True should print a list of one dictionary with all the fields:
{
  "yearID": "1960",
  "teamID": "BOS",
  "lgID": "AL",
  "playerID": "willite01",
  "G_all": "113",
  "GS": "87",
  "G_batting": "113",
  "G_defense": "86",
  "G_p": "0",
  "G_c": "0",
  "G_1b": "0",
  "G_2b": "0",
  "G_3b": "0",
  "G_ss": "0",
  "G_lf": "86",
  "G_cf": "0",
  "G_rf": "0",
  "G_of": "86",
  "G_dh": "0",
  "G_ph": "26",
  "G_pr": "0"
}

Testing Del by Temp:
Number of rows before delete 19617
Number of deleted rows 2
Number of rows after delete 19615

Testing Del by Key:--Number of deleted data points:
number of deleted data points:  1

Testing update by template:
Number of matching rows=  2
Number of updated rows should be equal to number of matching rows
Number of updated rows =  2

Testing update rows by key:
Number of matching rows=  1
Number of updated field =  1
Number of Rows =  19614
Number of Rows =  19615

Test insert method: One row with playerID = "brewech01" is selected. The player id is changes to avoid confusion in primary key.
Then this row is added to the end

Number of Rows before insert =  19615
Number of Rows after insert =  19616
